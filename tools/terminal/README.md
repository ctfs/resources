# Terminal

A terminal is the window where you can access multiple command-line interfaces, from the typical Bash shell to Python interpreter. Which emulator you choose is not very pertinent to CTFs, but if you are on windows you will have to go out of your way to find one.

## Linux

Luckily, all flavors of Linux and OSX come with a terminal built-in. It is usually found under applications and you can instantly access most command line tools from it.

## Windows

Since Windows is not based off of the same system as Linux and Mac, it has to rely on emulators to run shell commands.  There are quite a few emulators available for Windows, but one that is definitely worth checking out is [Cmder](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/). It is not an emulator per se but a package of useful 3rd party applications.  [GnuWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) is also a good option to get some of the most common and popular Linux commands on windows.
