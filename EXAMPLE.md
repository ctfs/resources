#Topic Name

In this first section a simple description of what the topic is can be written up. It can [cite sources to add information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) and provide an overview of what types of situations the topic is used in.

Here you can go into a little more depth about how the technology works and is used.  Some topics like public key cryptography, a complex and very math-based subject, can provide a simple overview of the technology and reference [more in-depth learning materials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction_to_Public-Key_Cryptography).

At this point you might want to give an every-day example of the topic and how it works, providing `code snippets`, links, and/or exercises for the reader to complete.  Usually generic and not very CTF-oriented.

##Detecting

After the topic has been introduced and explained, the CTF aspects can be introduced.  Start off with describing how the subject is usually presented in CTFS.  For example, SQL-injection challenges are usually presented through websites and forms. Describe some hints as to how to find out if this topic is involved in the challenge and ways to narrow down posibilities.

##Solving

Now the methods for solving the task can be presented. You can present standard ways of solving tasks manually, or [link specific tools that make them easier to solve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Starting_an_article).

##CTF Example

Now that the topic has been detailed extensively, you can add [examples of where this tech has shown up in previous CTFs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles).
